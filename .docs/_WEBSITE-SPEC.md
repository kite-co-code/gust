---

### events
Swimming events. Mirrors the trip post type in structure and purpose — events may also have multiple departures. The distinction is editorial/content rather than structural.

- Slug: events (plural)
- URL: /events/%postname%/
- Dashicon: dashicons-calendar-alt
- Supports: title, excerpt, thumbnail, revisions, custom-fields, slug
- Taxonomies: trip_style, skill_level, swim_type, country, location
- Editor: Gutenberg disabled — all content is managed via ACF fields and locked template sections

**Archive** (/events/)
- Template: Listing
- Route: decorate:post_type:events

**Fields:**

Events share the full field schema with trips — both post types are served by the shared `acf-json/group_trip_fields.json` field group. Every field documented on the `trip` content type above (Header, Stats, Dates & Booking incl. `trip_enquiry_url`, Intro & Galleries, Highlights, Itinerary & Stays, What's Included, Getting There, FAQs & Reviews, Promo, Related) is equally available on event singles. See the `trip` content type for the complete field reference.

The `itinerary` and `accommodation` post_object fields are available on events but are less commonly populated in practice.

Guides are standalone pages linked editorially — no ACF relationship field on events.

---

### itinerary
Reusable day-by-day itinerary documents. Assigned to trips via post_object field. One-to-one relationship with trip in practice, but designed to be reused across multiple trips with the same route. Publicly accessible and intended to be print-friendly — print stylesheet is a future requirement, not needed for scaffolding.

- URL: /itinerary/%postname%/
- Dashicon: dashicons-list-view
- Supports: title, editor, thumbnail, revisions, custom-fields
- Taxonomies: none

**Fields:**
- **preview_days** (repeater, max: 3) - First-three-days teaser used by Trip Itinerary Preview
  - **title** (text, required)
  - **summary** (textarea, required)

Full day-by-day content is authored via the Gutenberg editor. Target model: locked structured day blocks, with day numbering derived from order and optional standalone gallery blocks inserted between day sections — not yet implemented.

---

### story
Guest stories and reviews. Used in the Stories & Reviews section under About Us.

- URL: /story/%postname%/
- Dashicon: dashicons-format-quote
- Supports: title, editor, thumbnail, excerpt, revisions, custom-fields
- Taxonomies: none

**Fields:**
- **contributor_name** (text) - Byline name shown on story cards and singles. Leave blank to hide byline.

**Archive** (/story/)
- Template: Listing
- Route: decorate:post_type:story (registered in `Theme/Modules/Stories/module.php`, not `routes.php`)

---

### guide
Guide and coach biographies. Used in "Meet our team" section under About Us.

- URL: /guide/%postname%/
- Dashicon: dashicons-id-alt
- Supports: title, editor, thumbnail, revisions, custom-fields
- Taxonomies: none

**Fields:**

- Full biography authored via Gutenberg editor

---

- Post types: trip, events
- Hierarchical: no
- Rewrite slug: locations

**Term fields:**
- **subheading** (textarea) - Shown on the archive page header
- **image** (image, return: id) - Shown on the archive page header

Registered as public with rewrite enabled — WordPress generates archives at `/swim-type/%slug%/` but these are not linked from the front end. Used primarily as a filter.

---

## Standalone Routes

<!--
  Pages and routes not tied to content type archives.
-->

### Homepage (/)
- Template: Default

### Events Archive (/events/)
Decorated archive listing all upcoming events. Events with no upcoming `start_date` (including coming-soon events with no dates yet) are excluded. Ordered by nearest upcoming `start_date` ascending. See "Trip & Events Taxonomy Archive Ordering" below for the shared ordering logic.
- Template: Listing
- Route: decorate:post_type:events

### Search Results (/search/)
- Template: Default
- Route: decorate:search

### 404
- Template: Default
- Route: decorate:404

### Destinations (/destinations/)
Owned route scaffolded for a destination index page. Controller currently returns an empty string; intended output is an alphabetical index of country terms linking to /destinations/%slug%/.
- Template: Default
- Route: owned

### Trip Styles (/trip-styles/)
Overview/wayfinding page linking into all Trip Style taxonomy archives. Not a taxonomy archive itself — a static editorial page.
- Template: Default
- Route: owned

### Calendar (/calendar/)
Chronological listing of all upcoming trip departures, grouped by month. Shows one calendar entry per departure date for trips with multiple departures.

**Display Logic:**
- Lists all trips with at least one upcoming departure (start_date >= today)
- Trips with no dates yet (coming-soon) are excluded — the calendar is date-based by definition
- Shows multiple entries per trip when multiple departures are available
- Groups entries chronologically by month/year
- De-lists individual departures once their start_date has passed
- Completely removes trips once all departure start_dates are in the past

**Example:** Trip with departures April 4-11, April 27-May 4, April 29-May 6:
- Before April 4: Shows 3 entries
- April 12-26: Shows 2 entries (April 27 & April 29 departures)
- May 5-28: Shows 1 entry (April 29 departure only)
- After May 6: Trip completely removed

- Template: Default
- Route: owned

  Block status: [Block] = ACF Gutenberg block, [Partial] = PHP partial only
-->

### Site Header [Partial]

Top-of-page navigation rendered on every page. Hard-coded into the theme template — not editor-placeable.

**Render rule:**
- Always renders.

**Data source:**
- WP menu at the `header` theme location (top-level items and their first-level children)
- ACF option (`acf-options-header`): `header_call_to_action_1`
- Static assets: `logo-alt.svg` (default) and `logo-white.svg` (hero variant) — both rendered via `Gust\Image::get()`, both linked to home; visibility swapped by CSS based on header state
- Note: `social_networks` is not currently consumed by the header

**Top bar layout (both breakpoints):**
- Logo on the left
- On desktop: inline navigation + CTA on the right
- On mobile: burger toggle (label toggles "Menu" / "Close") on the right
- White background; bar is `position: fixed` at the top of the viewport once JS has set the `--site-header--top` offset (`.site-header--positioned` class) — this applies at all breakpoints
- Top offset is calculated from the WP admin bar plus any `[data-header-offset]` element and exposed as `--site-header--top`; downstream sticky elements (e.g. `.trip-section-nav`) use it to stack below the bar

**Scroll behaviour:**
- Bar stays fixed at the top of the viewport at all breakpoints — it does not hide on scroll
- A `.site-header--hidden` CSS hook exists for a future hide-on-scroll-down / reveal-on-scroll-up pattern, but no JS currently toggles it

**Transparent variant (hero pages):**
- JS detects hero pages by inspecting the first element inside `.site-main__content` (falls back to `.site-main__inner`, then `.site-main`); if it matches `.page-header.has-hero-image`, `.homepage-hero-header.has-background-image`, or `.trip-page-header`, the `.site-header--hero` class is added.
- **Desktop only:** bar background goes transparent and link, burger, and CTA divider colours invert to white; the white-variant logo (`logo-white.svg`) replaces `logo-alt.svg` while the bar overlays the hero image. Once the user scrolls past the bottom of the hero, JS adds `.site-header--scrolled` and the bar returns to solid white background with brand-navy logo + links (CTA divider returns to bright-blue).
- **Mobile:** no colour inversion. The bar keeps its solid white background and brand-navy logo + links regardless of the hero behind it.
- On pages without a matching hero element, the bar uses the solid white background by default at all breakpoints.

**Desktop behaviour (≥ `screens.site-header` breakpoint):**
- Top-level menu items render inline to the right of the logo
- Items with children show a dropdown caret (`v`) next to the label
- A vertical divider rule is rendered immediately before `header_call_to_action_1` to visually separate the primary nav from the CTA — bright-blue on the white variant, orange on the transparent hero variant, returns to bright-blue once `.site-header--scrolled` is set
- `header_call_to_action_1` renders as an inline uppercase display-type link after the menu
- Hovering or focusing a top-level item with children opens a full-width mega-menu panel anchored below the top bar:
  - Parent label as a heading at the top-left of the panel
  - Child links arranged in a 3-column grid
  - Closes on mouse-out / blur / Escape
- Burger toggle is hidden

**Mobile behaviour (< `screens.site-header` breakpoint):**
- Top bar shows logo + burger toggle (label toggles "Menu" / "Close"); the bar remains visible while the menu is open
- Tapping the burger opens a panel that starts immediately *below* the bar (so logo + toggle stay above it) and animates in via clip-path + opacity transition; panel content fades and slides up. Body scroll is locked while open via `no-scroll` on `<html>`.
- Panel body (vertical list, thin horizontal divider lines between top-level items):
  - Top-level menu items rendered in large League Gothic uppercase display type
  - Items with children show a chevron (right when collapsed, rotates to down when expanded) and expand **inline** to reveal child links indented beneath the parent — no separate sub-panel or drill-down. Sub-links use small body type with no uppercase transform.
  - `header_call_to_action_1` rendered inline within the list
- Tapping the burger again or pressing Escape closes the panel with the reverse animation
- No social-icon row is currently rendered in the panel

### Page Header [Block]

Full-width hero that auto-populates from the current page, post, term, or router page, with optional custom heading, subheading, CTA, and image. Block is restricted to `page` and `gust-template` post types.

**Fields:**
- **heading** (text) - Overrides the default title
- **subheading** (wysiwyg) - Supporting text
- **primary_call_to_action** (link) - Primary button link
- **image** (image, return: array) - Optional override image for the current object

**Programmatic-only inputs:**
- **back_link** (array with `url` and `label`) - Replaces breadcrumbs with a "Back" link. Injected automatically for accommodation/itinerary singles.

**Auto-population by context:**
- `post` (blog): hero featured image, adds publication date and author as meta, applies `article` type, removes background colour
- `story`: removes background and image, applies left-aligned variant (`page-header--align-left`), applies `story` type. Reads `contributor_name` field and renders "By {name}" as meta text.
- `guide`: square 300px featured image (when present), suppresses breadcrumbs, forces subheading to "Meet our team", removes background, applies `guide` type. The subheading renders **above** the heading, while the heading renders below — this is the only type where the order is reversed.
- `accommodation` / `itinerary`: removes background and image, applies left-aligned variant (`page-header--align-left`), suppresses breadcrumbs, injects a "Back" link to the post-type archive (falls back to home)
- `trip_style` term: pulls `subheading` from term-level ACF fields (`group_trip_style_taxonomy`); suppresses hero image on archives
- General `WP_Term`: reads `subheading` and `image` from term ACF fields if available
- `page` (top-level, no parent): suppresses breadcrumbs
- `page` (front page): adds `page-header--home` class, suppresses breadcrumbs

**Breadcrumb trailing-crumb rule:**
- Yoast breadcrumbs render the full trail in the DOM, including the current page as the last item (`<span class="breadcrumb_last" aria-current="page">`), with `aria-current="page"` preserved for assistive tech and the BreadcrumbList JSON-LD schema kept intact for SEO.
- Inside the page header, the last crumb and its preceding separator are visually hidden via CSS (`components/page-header/styles.pcss`) because the page heading directly below already shows the title. This avoids visible duplication while keeping accessibility and Google's BreadcrumbList structured-data intact.

### Trip Page Header [Block]

Trip hero section registered as `acf/trip-page-header`, restricted to the `trip` post type. Replaces `Page Header` on `trip` singles and combines editorial trip fields with derived trip metadata. Renders two zones: summary items (calendar, location, price) and stat items (duration, distance, etc.).

**Render rule:**
- Always present in the hard-coded `trip` template

**Auto-population logic:**
- Heading defaults to post title
- Date summary uses `Multiple dates` when more than one departure exists
- Location is built from `location` + `country`
- Price is derived from the cheapest `dates` row
- Ability level and swim type come from taxonomies
- Image falls back to featured image unless overridden
- CTA button rendered in the summary zone:
  - **At least one date row**: "View dates & book" anchor to `#trip-dates` (regardless of bookability status)
  - **No date rows + `trip_enquiry_url` set**: "Enquire" linking to that URL (new tab)
  - **No date rows + no enquiry URL anywhere**: non-linked "Coming Soon" label

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF and taxonomies on `trip`, plus optional per-block overrides

**Fields (block-level — `group_component_trip_page_header`, location: `block == acf/trip-page-header`):**
- **heading** (text) - Optional title override; falls back to post-level `trip_heading`, then post title
- **description** (textarea) - Hero summary paragraph; falls back to post-level `trip_description`
- **image** (image, return: array) - Optional hero image override; falls back to post-level `trip_header_image`, then featured image
- **non_swimmers_text** (text) - Block-level override for the Non-Swimming Partners banner; falls back to post-level `welcome_text`

The block-level group also exposes the stat fields below (`duration_nights`, `distance_min_km`, `distance_max_km`, `water_temp_min_c`, `water_temp_max_c`, `max_group_size`, `technique_coaching_text`) as optional per-block overrides for the same-named post-level fields.

**Fields (post-level — "Stats" tab in `group_trip_fields`):**
- **duration_nights** (number)
- **distance_min_km** (number)
- **distance_max_km** (number)
- **water_temp_min_c** (number)
- **water_temp_max_c** (number)
- **max_group_size** (number)
- **welcome_text** (text) - Non-Swimming Partners banner copy (overridable per-block via `non_swimmers_text`)
- **technique_coaching_text** (text)

### Trip Section Nav [Block]

Sticky trip-only section navigation under the hero, registered as `acf/trip-section-nav`. Jump links are generated dynamically based on which hard-coded sections actually have content.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if no eligible locked sections have content

**Auto-population logic:**
- Jump links cover: Highlights, Itinerary, Accommodation, What's Included, Getting There, Reviews, FAQs (only for sections with content). No jump link for Dates & Book.
- Primary (Enquiry) CTA — rendered only when an enquiry URL is available somewhere:
  - Multiple date rows with any row-level `enquiry_url`: anchor to `#trip-dates`
  - Single date row with `enquiry_url`: direct link to that row's URL
  - No date rows + trip-level `trip_enquiry_url` set: direct link to `trip_enquiry_url` (new tab)
  - No enquiry URL available anywhere: not rendered
- Secondary (Booking) CTA states:
  - Multiple dates: "View dates & book" anchor link to `#trip-dates`
  - Single bookable date with `booking_url`: "Book" linking to the external booking URL
  - Single sold-out date: non-linked "Sold Out" or "Private Group" label
  - Single bookable date with **no** `booking_url`: suppressed if an enquiry URL is available (Enquire stands alone); non-linked "Coming Soon" otherwise
  - No dates (coming-soon state): suppressed if an enquiry URL exists (Enquire stands alone); otherwise a non-linked "Coming Soon" label

**Fields:**
- No block fields. Derived from trip data and relationships.

### Trip Highlights [Block]

Locked Highlights section for the trip single page.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `highlights` is empty

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF: `highlights`

### Trip Itinerary Preview [Block]

Locked itinerary teaser on the trip page.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `itinerary` is not selected

**Data source:**
- Related post: `itinerary`
- Reads the `preview_days` repeater (max 3) from the linked itinerary post; each item has `title` (text) and `summary` (textarea)
- Fallback when `preview_days` is empty or every row has a blank title/summary: itinerary post title + excerpt (or first 60 words of content)
- CTA links to the itinerary permalink (opens in new tab)

### Trip Accommodation Preview [Block]

Locked accommodation teaser on the trip page.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `accommodation` is not selected

**Data source:**
- Related post: `accommodation`
- Pulls `description` (wysiwyg), tags, star rating, square gallery (max 3 images), rooms intro, and accommodation permalink as CTA
- The accommodation title renders as a link to the accommodation permalink when a URL is available
- "View accommodation" CTA opens in a new tab

### Trip Includes [Block]

Locked "What's included" section.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if both `included_items` and `not_included_items` are empty

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF: `included_items`, `not_included_items`

### Trip Getting There [Block]

Locked structured travel-information section.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `getting_there_stages` is empty

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF: `getting_there_stages` — full schema documented in the `trip` content type fields above

**Render notes:**
- Each stage's `general_note` is rendered beneath that stage's content (after the final step, or directly after `start_time` if the stage has no steps).
- `finish_time` is hoisted: the template scans stages in reverse and renders the last non-empty `finish_time` once, at the end of the final stage's content — not per-stage.

### Trip Reviews [Block]

Locked reviews embed section.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `reviews_embed_code` is empty

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF: `reviews_embed_code`

### Trip Related Stories [Block]

Manual related-story section at the end of the trip page.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `related_stories` is empty

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF relationship: `related_stories` (max: 2, post_type: story)
- Rendered via `Cards::make` with `type: horizontal`, `card_background_color: none`, and the `color-context-neutral` class

### Trip Related Trips [Block]

Manual related-trip section at the end of the trip page. Renders using `TripCards` (3-column layout).

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `related_trips` is empty

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF relationship: `related_trips` (max: 3, post_type: trip + events)

### Trip Single [Partial]

Top-level orchestrator for the entire trip single template. Validates the current post is a `trip`, reads the `faqs` ACF field, and delegates rendering to all locked trip components in layout order.

**Render rule:**
- Only renders when the current post is of type `trip`

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF: `faqs` (repeater with `question` (text) and `answer` (wysiwyg) sub-fields) — mapped into Accordion items
- Post-level ACF: `intro_gallery` and `mid_gallery` (gallery fields) — passed to `Gallery::make()` calls in the layout

### Trip Get In Touch [Partial]

Global "Get in touch" contact bar rendered on trip singles between Dates & Book and Related Stories. Driven by site-wide options, not per-trip fields. No section nav jump link is generated for this section.

**Render rule:**
- Do not render if `get_in_touch_contacts` option is empty

**Data source:**
- ACF options page (`acf-options-general`): `get_in_touch_contacts` repeater
- Sub-fields: `icon` (select: whatsapp, email, phone), `label` (text), `value` (text), `url` (text)

**Display behaviour per contact item:**
- `value` + `url`: renders label (bold) followed by linked value
- `value` only: renders label (bold) followed by plain value text
- `url` only (no value): renders label as a link; if `icon === whatsapp` the link opens with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`
- `icon === whatsapp` with both `value` and `url`: the link does NOT receive `target="_blank"` — only the url-only branch carries that attribute

### Get In Touch [Block]

Generic contact block (`acf/get-in-touch`) for use on any page. Distinct from `Trip Get In Touch` which reads from global options.

**Fields:**
- **contacts** (repeater)
  - **type** (text, required) - Contact method label, e.g. "Office", "Sales", "Email". Items where `type` equals "Email" render as an email entry; all others render as phone entries.
  - **value** (text, required) - Phone number or email address to display

### Image Full Width [Block]

Full-viewport-width image block (`acf/image-full-width`). Uses CSS breakout pattern (100vw, 600px height, object-cover).

**Fields:**
- **image** (image, return: id)

### Cards [Block]

Responsive card grid for taxonomy terms, editorial posts, and custom content. Does **not** handle Trip posts — use `TripCards` for those (exception: `TripRelatedTrips` uses `TripCards` for related trip rendering).

**Fields:**
- **heading** (text) - Section heading
- **subheading** (wysiwyg) - Supporting text
- **button** (link) - Optional footer link
- **card_source** (button_group: recent, selected, trip_styles, destinations, custom) - Source for the cards
- **custom_cards** (repeater, min: 1) - Manual card content shown when `card_source` is `custom`
  - **heading** (text)
  - **image** (image, return: array)
  - **text** (wysiwyg)
  - **link** (link)
- **post_type** (button_group: story) - Post type used when `card_source` is `recent`
- **limit** (button_group: 2, 3, 4, 6) - Number of recent posts to query; only shown in editor when `card_source` is `recent`
- **selected** (relationship, post_type: page, story, events, guide, max: 9) - Selected posts when `card_source` is `selected` (excludes `trip`)
- **selected_trip_styles** (taxonomy, trip_style, multi_select) - Specific trip styles when `card_source` is `trip_styles`; empty = all
- **selected_destinations** (taxonomy, country, multi_select, min: 2, max: 6) - Specific destinations when `card_source` is `destinations`; empty = all
- **type** (button_group: default, horizontal, carousel) - Switches card layout
- **card_image_fit** (select: default, contain) - Image fit mode
- **columns** (select: 2, 3, 4) - Grid column count
- **slider_on_mobile** (true_false) - Enable horizontal scroll on smaller screens. Conditionally hidden when `type` is `carousel`.

**Runtime behaviour:**
- When `card_source` is `trip_styles` or `destinations`, or when the programmatic `card_type` arg is `trip-style`, read-more button auto-sets to "Find Your Trip"; otherwise "Read More"
- On taxonomy archives, applies `cards--taxonomy-term-grid` CSS class
- When `type` is `horizontal`, column count is forced to 2 regardless of the `columns` field
- At mobile viewports, all `columns` settings collapse to 1 column; the configured column count applies from the `md` breakpoint upward

**Programmatic-only inputs (not editor fields):**
- **card_background_color** (text) - Adds `has-{color}-background-color` class
- **tag** (int) - Filters recent query by tag ID
- **card_type** (text) - When `trip-style`, also triggers "Find Your Trip" read-more label

### Card [Partial]

Single card renderer used by the `Cards` block and archive grids.

**Fields:**
- No editor fields. Consumes either a `WP_Post`, a `WP_Term`, or a prepared `content` array at runtime.

**Per-object-type runtime behaviour:**
- `WP_Post` of type `post`: card type set to `article`, `show_read_more` is false, meta shows publication date + author
- `WP_Post` of type `story`: card type set to `story`, `show_read_more` is false, meta shows `contributor_name` byline
- `WP_Post` of type `guide`: card type set to `guide`, `show_read_more` is false, meta shows the `role` ACF field
- `WP_Term`: image read from term-level `image` ACF field; subheading read from term-level `subheading` ACF field
- Excerpt fallback for any post: if no hand-written excerpt is present, falls back to the `page_header_content` ACF field

### TripCards [Block]

3-column grid of trip cards. Used as an editor block (with heading/subheading and source options) and also rendered programmatically on `trip_style` and `country` taxonomy archives.

**Fields:**
- **heading** (text) - Section heading
- **subheading** (wysiwyg) - Supporting text
- **card_source** (button_group: recent, selected) - Trip source
- **limit** (button_group: 3, 6) - Number of recent trips to query (max 6)
- **selected** (relationship, post_type: trip, min: 1, max: 6) - Manual trip selection when `card_source` is `selected`

**Block alignment**: Supports wide and full alignment; defaults to `align: full`.

**Archive usage:**
- `trip_style`, `country`, and `location` taxonomy archives render TripCards with the queried trips (no block fields, populated from the archive query)

**Programmatic-only inputs (not editor fields):**
- **button** (link array) - Optional footer link, rendered with `btn` class when set

### TripCard [Partial]

Single trip card renderer used by `TripCards`. Consumes a `WP_Post` of type `trip` and derives all display data from post-level ACF fields and taxonomies.

**Layout (top to bottom):**
1. Image (featured image, `gust_card_square` size)
2. Title (trip name)
3. Meta list with icons:
   - Dates: single range or "Multiple dates"
   - Location: `location` + `country` taxonomy terms
   - Skill levels: `skill_level` taxonomy terms, comma-separated
4. Price: "From" on first line, "£X,XXX" on second line (cheapest departure from `dates` repeater)

  - **title** (text)
  - **content** (wysiwyg)

### Banner [Partial]

Compact banner with inline image and message. The ACF block registration is currently disabled (`block.json.disabled` in the component directory) — Banner is rendered programmatically, not from the editor.

**Fields:**
- **image** (image, return: array) - Icon, logo, or image displayed inline with the banner message

- **image_height** (range, default: 26) - Inline image height in pixels

**Programmatic-only inputs:**
- **show_close_button** (bool) - When true, renders a dismissable close button. Not editor-exposed.

**Calling convention:** `Banner::make()` takes a single `array $args = []` (positional array, not named parameters). Callers must pass `Banner::make(['field' => value])` rather than `Banner::make(field: value)`.

- **display** (text, default: `grid`) - Passed to the template as `logo-grid--{$display}` class

### Media & Content [Partial]

- **role** (text) - Role or title

### Trip Dates [Block]

Server-rendered departure list for the current trip.

**Fields:**
- No block fields. Reads the current trip's `dates` repeater field. Night count and price-display fields are computed and rendered on each departure row.
- `status` choices: bookable, sold_out, sold_out_private ("Sold Out - Private Group"). The `sold_out_private` status renders a disabled "Private Group" CTA with a distinct modifier class.

### Taxonomy Filters [Partial]

Derived filter bar that renders term links for the current taxonomy or object context.

**Fields:**
- No editor fields. Runtime inputs include `taxonomy`, `current_item`, `label`, and `show`. The `label` defaults to "Filter by {taxonomy singular name}" when a taxonomy is provided.

**Fields:**
- **title** (text, required)
- **subheading** (text)
- **link** (link)

**Programmatic-only inputs:**
- **post_id** (int) - When provided, falls back to that post's `promo_title`, `promo_subheading`, and `promo_link` ACF fields

### Testimonial Cards [Block]

**Fields:**
- No editor fields. Driven by the active trip query.

### Event Single [Partial]

Top-level orchestrator for the entire `events` single template. Validates the current post is of type `events`, reads the `faqs`, `intro_gallery`, and `mid_gallery` ACF fields, and delegates rendering to all locked event components in layout order. Byte-identical in structure to `trip-single/template.php`.

**Render rule:**
- Only renders when the current post is of type `events`

**Layout order:** Trip Page Header, Section Nav, Trip Intro, Gallery (intro), Highlights, Itinerary Preview, Gallery (mid), Accommodation Preview, What's Included, Getting There, Reviews, FAQs, Dates & Book, Promo, Get In Touch, Related Stories, Related Trips

**Data source:**
- Post-level ACF: `faqs` (repeater with `question` and `answer` sub-fields) — mapped into Accordion items

**Programmatic-only inputs:**
- **video** (oembed string) - Embed URL (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---

## Integrations

<!-- Third-party services and APIs -->

- **Feefo** - Customer reviews embedded on trip single pages
  - Integrated via the `Trip Reviews` block component which reads the `reviews_embed_code` ACF field on each trip
  - Embed code is output raw (unescaped) to support Feefo's widget scripts

---

## Other Functionality

<!-- Custom features, cron jobs, CLI commands, special behaviors -->

<!-- Example:
- **Event expiry** - Events automatically unpublished 24h after end date (wp-cron)
- **Import CLI** - `wp import-events` pulls events from external API
- **Member area** - Password-protected pages for logged-in users
-->

### Archive Behaviour

**Summary**

| Route | Post types listed | Ordering | Filter | Per page |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/events/` | `events` | Nearest upcoming `start_date` ASC | Posts with no upcoming date excluded | 12 |
| `/trip-styles/{slug}/` | `trip` + `events` | Nearest upcoming `start_date` ASC | Posts with no upcoming date excluded | 12 |
| `/destinations/{slug}/` | `trip` + `events` | Nearest upcoming `start_date` ASC | Posts with no upcoming date excluded | 12 |
| `/locations/{slug}/` | `trip` + `events` | Nearest upcoming `start_date` ASC | Posts with no upcoming date excluded | 12 |
| `/calendar/` | `trip` (one row per departure) | `start_date` ASC, grouped by month | Past departures de-listed; trips with no upcoming dates excluded | n/a (full list) |
| `/story/` | `story` | `post_date` DESC (WP default) | None | 12 |
| `/swim-type/{slug}/` | `trip` + `events` | `post_date` DESC (WP default) | None | WP default — not linked from front end |

Note: `trip_style`, `country`, `location`, and `swim_type` are all registered to both `trip` and `events`, so both post types appear together on those taxonomy archives.

### Trip & Events Taxonomy Archive Ordering

Applies to `/trip-styles/{slug}/`, `/destinations/{slug}/`, `/locations/{slug}/`, and `/events/`. Implemented in `Theme/Modules/Trips/module.php::orderTaxonomyArchives` and `Theme/Modules/Events/module.php::filterArchiveToUpcomingEvents`, both via `pre_get_posts` on the main query. Shared ordering logic lives in `Theme/Utils/TripData::getUpcomingPostIds()`.

**Default ordering:**
- Posts ordered by the nearest upcoming `dates.start_date` ascending (soonest departure first)
- Both `trip` and `events` post types are included on the shared taxonomy archives (since `trip_style`, `country`, `location` are registered to both)
- `posts_per_page` is set to 12 on each archive

**Exclusions:**
- Posts with no upcoming `start_date` (every `dates` row in the past, or `dates` repeater empty) are excluded entirely
- This means "coming soon" trips/events with no scheduled dates do **not** appear on any archive or on the calendar — they remain accessible only via their single-page URLs and any manual editorial links

**Manual override — Simple Custom Post Order plugin:**
- The `simple-custom-post-order` plugin is installed; the client uses it to order taxonomy **terms** (currently configured for `trip_style` only — see `scporder_options.tags`)
- If the plugin is later configured to manage post ordering for `trip` or `events` (`scporder_options.objects` contains either), the date-based ordering above is skipped on these archives and the plugin's manual `menu_order` is respected
- If the plugin is deactivated entirely, the date-based ordering remains as a sensible fallback
